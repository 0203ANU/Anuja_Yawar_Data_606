## Capstone Project by Anuja Yawar and Devarsh Bhavinkumar Shah
### Amazon Stock Prediction - Time Series
**Goal:** 
Developing a machine learning model that can accurately predict the future movements of stock prices, based on historical data and other relevant 
factors. The model should be able to handle the complexity and volatility of the stock market, and provide reliable predictions for a variety of 
stocks and indices. The goal is to help investors and financial institutions make informed decisions, minimize risks, and maximize returns in the 
stock market.
<br><br>
**Framework:**
- Gathering Data: Amazon stock data is collected from [YahooFinance](https://finance.yahoo.com/) by fetching website's API and converting it into CSV 
to load into Panda's dataframe. <br>
- Data Exploration: Understanding the Structure of data such , variables, data types, missing values, Univariate Analysis, Outlier Detectio and finally
summarizing data by creating visualization.<br>
- Machine learning model: We will try to fit popular timeseries models like ARIMA, LSTM and Prophet. <br>
- Deployment: Streamlit 
<br><br>
**Provided in this repository is Jupyter Notebook for code, PowerPoint presentation, Deployment Link and the Project Video.**

**What did we learn from the project?** 
- One key lesson is that stock market prediction is an extremely difficult task. While historical trends and patterns can be useful indicators, the stock 
market is influenced by a multitude of unpredictable factors, such as economic conditions, geopolitical events, and natural disasters, among others. 
This complexity makes it challenging to accurately predict stock market trends over the long-term, and even short-term predictions can be subject to 
significant uncertainty.

- Another important insight is that data analysis and machine learning techniques can be valuable tools for making informed investment decisions. 
By analyzing historical stock data and identifying patterns, investors can gain insights into market trends and make more informed decisions about
when to buy or sell stocks. However, it is important to recognize that no model is perfect, and even the most advanced machine learning algorithms 
have limitations and potential sources of error. Investors should always use caution and conduct thorough research before making investment decisions.
