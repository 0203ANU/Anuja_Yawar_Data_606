## Amazon Stock Prediction - Time Series <br><br>
**Goal:** Developing a machine learning model that can accurately predict the future movements of stock prices, based on historical data and other relevant factors. The model should be able to handle the complexity and volatility of the stock market, and provide reliable predictions for a variety of stocks and indices. The goal is to help investors and financial institutions make informed decisions, minimize risks, and maximize returns in the stock market.

**Framework:** 
<br><br>
Gathering Data: Amazon stock data is collected from YahooFinance by fetching website's API and converting it into CSV to load into Panda's dataframe.
<br>
Data Exploration: Understanding the Structure of data such , variables, data types, missing values, Univariate Analysis, Outlier Detectio and finally summarizing data by creating visualization.
<br>
Machine learning model: We will try to fit popular timeseries models like ARIMA, LSTM and Prophet.
<br>
Deployment: Streamlit
